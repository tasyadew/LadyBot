> Arduino Project for 2 years. Still in a prototype phase.

## About This Project
It is an **Arduino Vacuum Robot With Air Purifier Controlled Via Bluetooth**, or in other word: Roomba + Air freshener + Mobile Apps to control the robot.

This is the longest project I worked on with my teammates (a team of 4 people) and has achieved 3 awards in total. The project has been worked on for over 2 years from late 2016 until mid 2018 with estimated total hours of 500 hours. The total time taken is including the time to learn and research, time to make thesis and report, and the time to debug and improve the robot from malfunctioning. 

## My role
I am the leader of this project. I code, design and test the prototype to make sure it is functional. I am also in charge of communicating with my teacher, who is the supervisor of this project if the project requires the use of lab.

## The awards
In order of first competition to final competition:

| COMPETITION NAME                      | YEAR|LOCATION|LEVEL | AWARDS |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Young Innovator's Challenge     | 2017|Malacca  | District|Bronze|
| Tunas Saintis MRSM Se-Malaysia   | 2018   | MRSM Transkian, Pulau Pinang |National|Participation|
| International Engineering Invention & Innovation Exhibition (i-Envex) | 2018   | Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP) |International|Gold|

## What have I learn
There are a lot of things that I have learned that I have not considered when I first started this project. At first, I thought it was as simple as trying to combined a roomba prototype with an air purifier. As time passes, the project becomes more advanced and complicated until there are times I wanted to completely abandoned this project and quit the competition. However, I keep on working and researching on ways to improve a few of my errors out of thousands of errors.

Summary of what I learned:
- How to work with sensors (infrared, PIR, Ultrasonic, etc.)
- Bluetooth connectivity of robot and mobile application
- Electronics and finding the voltage overflow
- Air flow of a vacuum and how it works
- The load that the robot can handle, or else it doesn't move
- Learn solidwork to 3D print the body of LadyBot (the third version)

## Future of this project 
This prototype is far from perfect and the standard I set. The code is not optimized and the engineering and electronic part is also not safe. This project will be archieved and no longer updated because I want to remake this project from beginning. If I remake this project, I will link it to a new repository.

## Note
If you are interested with this project, feel free to use this work. I am allowing anyone to make an improvement of this project. No need to give credit.
